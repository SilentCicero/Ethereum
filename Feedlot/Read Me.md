#Feedlot - A Decentralized Price Feed Market Place

** This project is in its alpha stages, so excuse the late night coding.

Feedlot, based on the Trusted Feeds.org idea, is an on-chain decentralized feed exchange where feed buyers can request feeds and have trusted feed providers respond to their requests.

The buyer can then allow the feed provider to build a feed onto the feed request, if the feed provider likes what they see, the payment will go through and the provider will be paid.

All feeds are publically accessible, the initial feed buyer gets access for free, while others will have to pay the feed price.
