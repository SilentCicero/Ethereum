# Feedlot - A Decentralized Price Feed Marketplace

** This project is in its alpha stages, so excuse the late night coding.

Feedlot, based on the Trusted Feeds.org idea, is an on-chain
decentralized feed exchange where feed buyers can request feeds and have
trusted feed providers respond and build feeds to their request.

The buyer can then allow the feed provider to build a feed onto the feed request, if the feed provider likes what they see, the payment will go through and the provider will be paid.

All feeds are publically accessible, the initial feed buyer gets access
for free, while others will have to pay the feed price.
